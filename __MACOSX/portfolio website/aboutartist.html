    My name is Zachary Milazzo and I'm a student at Illinois State university. Only recently have I been actually pursuing being an artist,
   since now is the time in my life for me to start considering what I want to do for the remainder of it. Character design has always
   been my area of interest, I just realize it. And once I got to college and browsed the possibilities, I made it my goal to take the
   characters that I've created in my head and get them down on paper. <br> <br> I mainly draw original characters that I come up with,
   sometimes through Dungeons and Dragons, sometimes through other means, like brainstorming with friends about make believe worlds.
   I plan to start a comic one day, hopefully put it on Webtoonz and have others read it. Just a slice of life comic, nothing too serious.
   I'm nowhere near doing so now, but one of these days I'll get good enough to create an artstyle I can stick with. Until then, I'll just have to keep practicing
   and keep throwing pencils at the wall in frustration to "why that hand looks like that" or "how do you draw a human eye again?"
